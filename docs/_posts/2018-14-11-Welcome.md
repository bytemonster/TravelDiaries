Hello Everyone, and wellcome to my little spot on the internet. I am Nefeli and I will try my best to take you with me to my travels and share the things that make each place unique to me. 
* So who am I? I am a traveler, a web developer, a constant student, a self-taught creative, and - if I am to be honest - a child at heart. 
* Where am I taking you? That is a tricky one to answer. You see at the time that I am writing this I am in Taiwan, in a small township called Linbian. You will hear a lot about this area and the people I am very fortunate to live with, since this is a very unique experience for me. Yet my travels did not start nor will they end here. So from time to time I will try to dig up older photos from other journeys and wright about my memories -good , bad and silly. You can expect these "throw backs" to be, among others, from Greece (my home), Switcherland, Cuba, Italy, India, Quatar etc.
* What do I do in my journeys? I usually find my self in nature (especially when people drag me to sporty activities). I am passionate about food so local delicasies will not be rare either. I love meeting new people and spend time to find out more about them so expect to be introduced too. Additionally weird and funny stories are also common in my trips since I tend to find my self in weird and funny sytuations a lot!

Thanks a lot for passing by and hope you found something interesting to read!
